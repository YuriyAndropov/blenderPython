Python scripts for Blender
========================== 
Here you can find a scripts that I've made for Blender. Release versions are in separate folders with proper name. Everyting that is in the root is wip , test , etc.

Scripts that are in the release versions:

# A*Stats
This a script to draw selection stats in the UI. There are a lot of optiona in the add-on preferences where you can change postion,color, size of the statistics.
This addon just takes the buil-in stats, so it will not show correctly stats for the meshes with modifiers.
I have 2 addional option to show tris and materials, but they are heavy for perfomance. Everyting is updated every frame so be aware that it can kill the perfomace. It works fine for low-polys and it was made just for that.
